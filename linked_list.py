# LinkedList: A doubly-linked list.
# Bonus: Has an insert_in_order that, when used, keeps the values of
#        each node in ascending order.
# Implement as many operations as possible with recursion.
# If you can't figure it out recursively, use a loop. (But then refactor
# your implementation into a recursive one!)
# Your implementation should pass the tests in test_sorted_list.py.
# YOUR NAME
